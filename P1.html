			<p class="background-description">Diaz-Aguilar-Madrid, the lineage of our tamales making. As a young girl, I loved being in the kitchen with my mom when it came to tamales making time, she made it look so easy. The first part I learned, and helped with, was assembling the tamales. After many years I learned how to prepare all the ingredients that go into the making of a tamal. I have been making them on my own since sollege and have shared the knowledge with some of my siblings, their families, and my kids. Nothing is better any time of year, but especially Christmas time, than a kitchen full of the ones you love, preparing a food with decades of tradition and memories. So come and get you some DAM tamales this  holiday season while you can! Made with love.</p>
